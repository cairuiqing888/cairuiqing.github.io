## Bio

<p style="font-family: garamond, serif; font-size:12pt">
I am first-year Master of Health Science student in Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (BSPH), set to achieve a Master's in Infectious Diseases Epidemiology by 2025. With a multidisciplinary professional background in both Public Health and Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University during my undergraduate study, I delved deep into research in infectious disease dynamics (Epidemiology), vaccine development (Biochemistry), and battery cell advancements (Chemistry). My pivotal projects encompassed disease modeling in Virginia via R programming and substantial contributions to rotavirus vaccine research. As I advance in my academic journey at Johns Hopkins, my ambition is to bolster my statistical acumen and conduct more in-depth research on infectious disease transmission and dynamic analysis. My ultimate aim is to play an instrumental role in preventing and controlling emerging infectious diseases in the future.
